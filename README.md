Command-line Tools
==================
_A collection of tools to keep my own computers running_


## Description
A collection of tools that I have made over the years to make runnning my computers easier.
If they are useful to you, feel free to grab them. They are configured like suck-less tools
so you modify the header file to suite your needs. The original shell versions are there
mostly for reference.

## Project Meta
All software in this repo is in an *Alpha* state, so it might be broken when you run them.
